# 3D-models

Built this for the sake of adding models into school event websites, however ya can use it as a model gallery or add them to yours as well by using <model-viewer> and embedded componenets
No watermark, yummy interactive and fast loading models

Some of these dont work good with transparent bgs tho, are colorless, or are too heavy. However most of these work perfectly fine and are quite light
